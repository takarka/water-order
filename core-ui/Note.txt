Angular best practices

1. Container Components (Services Providers, Pipes, Directives etc.): 
These components know how to retrieve data from the service layer. 
Note that the top-level component of a route is usually a Container 
Component, and that is why this type of components where originally named like that
2. Presentational Components (UI components) :
These components simply take data as input and know how to display it on the screen. 
They also can emit custom events

3. changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush

// TOP FIXED (TOOLBAR OR BUTOON BAR)
{
    position:fixed;
    width:100%;
    top:0;
    left:0;
    border-sizing:border-box;
}
